# PushBack
PushBack transports and constructs Drupal instances from metadata, deploying the provisioned site to dev or production instances. Post-deployment UI testing is supported via CasperJS.

PushBack currently serves as the primary Drupal instance deployment and management tool at UNB Libraries.
